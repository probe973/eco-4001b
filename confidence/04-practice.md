A class from the Environmental Science School collects **20** samples of water from a lake. The **mean** pH value of the 20 samples is **8.2**

The local council collects **100** samples from the lake and gets a **mean** pH of **8**.

It is **known that the standard deviation of the pH values for the lake is 0.6**.
