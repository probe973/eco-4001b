# Distributions Workshop

A statistical distribution maps out all the values a variable can take and shows the frequency or likelihood with which each value will occur across its range.

The **normal distribution** is the most widely applied theoretical model in statistics, characterised by its symmetrical bell shape where the data is highly concentrated at the centre.
