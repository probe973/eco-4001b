## Chebyshev's Inequality

**Chebyshev's Theorem** provides an *estimate* for the *minimum* proportion of values that lie within a given number of standard deviations from the mean.

For any given distribution, the minimum proportion of observations that lie within $k$ standard deviation of the mean ($k>1$), is given by:

$$1-\frac{1}{k^2}$$

For example, the minimum proportion of observations that lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean (so between the mean minus 3 standard deviations and the mean plus 3 standard deviations) is:

$$1-\frac{1}{3^2}=1-\frac{1}{9}=\frac{8}{9} \approx 89 \% $$

This also implies that **at most** 11% of observations lie **outside of 3 standard deviations from the mean**

An estimate for the maximum number of observations that lie outside of $k$ standard deviations ($k>1$) is given by:

$$\frac{1}{k^2}$$
