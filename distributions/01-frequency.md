## Frequency, Cumulative Frequency, Relative Frequency, Cumulative Relative Frequency

### Frequency
**Frequency** is a numerical value that says how many occurrences of an item or value there have been.  For continuous data, it may show the number of occurrences within a range.

### Cumulative frequency
**Cumulative frequency** is a running total of frequencies.  It shows the number of occurrences that are less than or equal to the current value.  The last value in the cumulative frequencies will be the total frequency.

### Relative frequency
**Relative frequency** is the frequency divided by the total frequency.  It gives the proportion of the data that are within this group.

### Cumulative relative frequency
**Cumulative relative frequency** is the running total of the relative frequencies. It gives the proportion of the data that are less than or equal to the current value.  The last value in the cumulative relative frequencies will be 1, representing 100% of the data.

Cumulative relative frequency can be used to find **percentiles** of the data.  For example, the 10th percentile is the point where 10% of values are below this and 90% of values are above this.  You can look to see where the cumulative relative frequency passes the percentile value.  The **median** is the 50th percentile.

### Question

A bar sells scratch cards, for £3, where the customer can win between £0 and £10, in whole number of £.  The winnings record over the past 250 cards sold is given as a frequency table.
