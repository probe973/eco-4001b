## Emprical Rule for Normal Distributions

Distributions that are described as **normally distributed** have a particular shape and have defined characteristics.

* **Symmetry**: The curve is perfectly symmetrical around its center, meaning the left side is a mirror image of the right.
* **Bell Shape**: It forms a distinctive bell curve, with the highest point at the mean and tails that extend infinitely but never touch the x-axis (asymptotic).
* **Central Tendency**: The mean, median, and mode are all identical and located at the peak (center) of the distribution.
* **Defined by Mean & Standard Deviation**: Only two parameters, the mean (μ, center) and standard deviation (σ, spread), are needed to describe any normal distribution.
* **Empirical Rule** (68-95-99.7):
* About 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation (±σ) of the mean.
* About 95% falls within 2 standard deviations (±2σ).
* About 99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations (±3σ).
* **Concentration**: Data points are most frequent near the mean and become less probable further away in the tails.

### Example

This information allows you to know that if a distribution is normally distributed that

* 68% of the data lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean
* 34% (100 - 68) of the data lie beyond 1 standard deviation of the mean
* By symmetry, 17% (34/2) of the data lie above 1 standard deviation of the mean and 17% of the data lie below 1 standard deviation of the mean

correct_answer="97.5"
tolerance="0.005"
solution_text="Standard deviation is the square root of variance, 15000 hours is then 2 standard deviations below the mean.  Use symettry to work out the probability above this."
