# Binomal Distribution

So, if we have fixed $n$, independent trials, binary outcomes (often referred to as **success** and **fail**), and constant probability of $p$.

If $X = \text{"the number of successes"}$, then we write:

$$X \sim B(n, p)$$

You can work out the probability of **x** successes with the formula:

$$P(X=x) = {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$

The online calculator below can also do this for you.

### Example

The probability that an archer hits the bull is known to be a constant 0.7.  The archer takes 5 shots.

* What is the probability that they hit the bull exactly 4 times?

$X \sim B(5, 0.7)$

$P(X = 4) = {5 \choose 4} \times 0.7^4 \times 0.3^1 = 0.360$

* What is the probability that they hit the bull 4 or more times?

$P(X \geq 4) = P(X=4)+P(X=5) = {5 \choose 4} \times 0.7^4 \times 0.3^1 + {5 \choose 5} \times 0.7^5 \times 0.3^0 = 0.528$

* What is the probability that they hit bull fewer than 4 times?

$P(X \lt 4) = 1 - P(X \geq 4) = 1 - 0.528 = 0.472$

You can also get these results by putting $p=0.7, n=5, x=4$ in the calculator above.


## Mean and Variance of a Binomial Distribution

The mean, $\mu$, or expected value $E(X)$ of a binomial distribution $X \sim (n, p)$ is given by:

$$\mu = E(X) = np$$

The variance $\sigma^2$ or $\text{Var}(X)$ is given by:

$$\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$$

So in the **archer example** above:

Expected hits of the bull: $\mu = 5 \times 0.7 = 3.5$

Variance: $\sigma^2 = 5 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 = 1.05$

### Questions

1. The “Pecs Bar & Gym” knows, from experience, that the probability that its rather old coffee vending machine works correctly with a purchase is 0.8. A customer is about to order 6 drinks.

tolerance="0.0005"
solution_text="More than 1 failed means 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 fails.  This represents 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 successes, so looking for 4 or less successes, $P(D \leq 4) = 1-P(D>4)=1-(P(D=5)+P(D=6))$"
