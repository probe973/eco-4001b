# The Binomial Coefficient

The binomial coefficient is the number of ways of picking $k$ unordered outcomes from $n$ possibilities, and is written $n \choose k$ or $^nC_k$.

So the number of ways we can choose **2** outcomes from the set of **3** items A, B, C, where order doesn't matter:

AB, AC, and BC

So, ${3 \choose 2} = 3$, as there were 3 possibilities.

If we wanted to choose **2** outcomes from the set of **4** items A, B, C, D:

AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD

So ${4 \choose 2} = 6$

### Formula

$${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

So for the second example above:

$${4 \choose 2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \times 2!} = \frac{24}{2 \times 2} = 6$$

You may also have a button on your calculator, something like `nCx` and you can use it like `4` `nCx` `2`.


The coefficient also tells how many ways you can get $k$ successes in $n$ trials.  For example, if you can either succeed or fail, and you complete **5** trials, how many different ways can you get **2** successes?

S - success, F - fail
