# Factorials

Consider how many ways the letters ABC can be arranged:

ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA

There are six ways.

This number can be calculated by working out $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$.  

This number is written as $3!$ and pronounced **3 factorial**.

So to calculate the number of ways the letters ABCDE can be arranged:

$$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$$

You may also have a button on your calculator `!` that you can use.
