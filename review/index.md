# ECO-4001B Review Questions


## Formula and tables

Sample mean

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x}}{n}$$

Sample variance

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}$$

One-sample t-statistic

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

Two-sample t-statistic

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}$$

Pooled variance

$$s^2_p = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s^2_1 + (n_2 -1)s^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$$

## Questions

Underground Airways is conducting a review of their customers and their own operations.

### Question 1

Data are collected to find annual income of passengers booking a business class ticket. The annual incomes of customers are known to follow a normal distribution. A sample of 16 customers were asked for their annual income:

Annual income (thousands £):
    
60.3, 46.3, 45.7, 45.9, 45.6, 38.6, 63.8, 46.5, 53.6, 37.5, 54.1, 63.9, 49.9, 58.2, 42.9, 63.2

These data can be summarised:

{% capture review_table_1 %}

%}

Historically the mean annual income of business class ticket customers was £47000. Underground Airways want to test, with this sample, whether this has changed.

### Question 2

Underground Airways also offer a ‘business plus’ ticket. From a sample of customers’ incomes for this ticket:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Statistic</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Observations</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mean</td>
      <td>57</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Median</td>
      <td>56.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Standard Deviation</td>
      <td>8.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% include question_confidence_interval.html
    id="review_2a"
    title="2 a"
    question_text="Find the 90% confidence interval for the mean.  Give answers to 1 d.p."
    lower_answer="53.7"
    upper_answer="60.3"
    tolerance="0.05"
    solution_text="From tables, the critical t-value is 1.729 <br> $57 \pm 1.729 \times \frac{8.5}{\sqrt{20}}=(53.7, 60.3)$"
%}

A t-test is carried out to determine if the mean is significantly different from £52000.  The results give:

$$t(19) = 2.6307, p = .0165$$

{% include question_dropdown.html
    id="review_2b"
    title="2 b"
    question_text="Interpret this result."
    solution_text="$p<0.05$ and so the null hypothesis would be rejected at the 5% level. <br> At the 5% level there is evidence that the mean salary differs from £52000. <br><br> As $p>0.01$ there is not enough evidence to reject at the 1% level."
%}

### Question 3

A sample of the Underground Airways customers were asked to rate their experience of the company through a series of questions. From these questions a satisfaction score can be calculated. A summary of the satisfaction scores by business and business plus passengers:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Statistic</th>
      <th>Business</th>
        <th>Business PLus</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Observations</td>
      <td>120</td>
        <td>130</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mean</td>
      <td>18</td>
        <td>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Standard Deviation</td>
      <td>6</td>
        <td>6.8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

 A t-test will be be performed to test for a significant difference between satisfaction scores for business and business plus customers.

 {% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="review_3a"
    title="3 a"
    question_text="What are the null and alternative hypotheses of the two sample test?"
    options="eq::$H_0: \mu_B = \mu_P$  $H_1: \mu_B = \mu_P$|| neq::$H_0: \mu_B = \mu_P$  $H_1: \mu_B \neq \mu_P$ || gt::$H_0: \mu_B = \mu_P$  $H_1: \mu_B > \mu_P$ || lt::$H_0: \mu_B = \mu_P$  $H_1: \mu_B < \mu_P$"
    correct_answer="neq"
    solution_text="The null hypothesis is that the mean of the two groups are equal.  Looking for a difference so the alternative hypothesis is that the two means are not equal."
%}

{% include question_numerical.html
    id="review_3b"
    title="3 b"
    question_text="Calculate the pooled standard deviation.  Give answer correct to 2 decimal places."
    correct_answer="6.43"
    tolerance="0.01"

%}

{% include question_numerical.html
    id="review_3c"
    title="3 c"
    question_text="Calculate the t-statistic.  Give answer correct to 2 decimal places."
    correct_answer="2.46"
    tolerance="0.01"
    solution_text="$t=\frac{20-18}{6.43 \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{120} +\frac{1}{130} \right )}}=2.46$"
%}

{% include question_dropdown.html
    id="review_3d"
    title="3 d"
    question_text="At the 5% significance level what conclusion would you draw about the difference in satisfaction rating between the two passenger groups?"
    solution_text="Two-tail test. The critical t value, using tables, is 1.96. <br> Since 2.46 exceeds this critical value, we will reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence of a difference between the mean satisfaction scores of business and business plus customers."
%}

### Question 4

Underground Airways record data, over a particular week, for how the tickets are booked. They offer Economy, Business, Business Plus and First Class tickets that can all be booked by visiting a travel agent, over the phone or on the internet. The number of customers for these factors can be summarised in the table:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Passengers</th>
      <th>Economy</th>
      <th>Business</th>
      <th>Bus. Plus</th>
      <th>First Class</th>
      <th>TOTAL</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Travel Agent</td>
          <td>25</td>
          <td>18</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>23</td>
          <td>70</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Phone</td>
          <td>120</td>
          <td>80</td>
          <td>45</td>
          <td>45</td>
          <td>290</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Internet</td>
          <td>140</td>
          <td>90</td>
          <td>65</td>
          <td>25</td>
          <td>320</td>

          <td>93</td>
          <td>680</td>
