## Venn Diagrams

A **Venn diagram** is a graphical display of frequencies or probabilities of multiple events.  Each event is represented by a cirlce and all the circles are placed within a rectangle.  The rectangle represents the **sample space**, which represents everything that can happen.  The total of the frequencies or probabilities in the rectangle add up to the total frequency or 1 respectively.  Overlaps in the circles represent frequencies or probabilities of all the overlapping events occurring.

## Questions

At the bar of the company ‘The Pecs Bar & Gym’, customers can pay for items via different means.  30% of customers now use NFC on their smartphone to pay at the bar.  The company also has an app that gives news, information and offers to customers, 70% of customers have installed this app.  20% of customers use their smartphones to pay and have the company app.

Using the Venn diagram, or otherwise, calculate the following probability (as a decimal number to no more than 3 decimal places) that a customer:

## Independent Events

If there are two events $A$ and $B$ and we find that $P(A \text{ given } B) = P(A)$, then the event B occurring did not effect the probability of A.  In this case we say that events $A$ and $B$ are **independent events**.
