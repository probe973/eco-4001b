# Discrete Random Variable Probability Distribution

The **probability distribution** of a discrete random variable shows all of the possible outcomes along with its associated probability.

**The sum of the probabilities will be 1**

If $X$ is a discrete random variable then:

$P(X=1)$ means the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on the value 1.  You may also see this written as simply $P(1)$.

$P(X<5)$ means the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on a value less than 5.

**Question 1** refers to the discrete random variable $X$, which can take on values of $x = {1, 2, 3, 4}$.  Its probability distribution looks like:

| $x$ | $P(X=x)$ |
|:----|:----|
| 1 | 0.2 |
| 2 | 0.4 |
| 3 | 0.25 |
| 4 | ? |

solution_text="The value can be 1 or 2, with probabilities of 0.2 and 0.4."
%}


**Question 2** refers to the discrete random variable $Y$, which can take on values of $y = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$.  Its probability distribution looks like:

| $y$ | $P(Y=y)$ |
|:----|:----|
| 0 | ? |
| 1 | 0.12 |
| 2 | 0.22 |
| 3 | 0.15 |
| 4 | ? |

It is known that $P(Y = 0) = 2P(Y = 4)$
