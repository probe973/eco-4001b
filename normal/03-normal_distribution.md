title: Using the Normal Distribution

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">

# Using the Normal Distribution

Once we have defined a normal distribution, $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we often want to find the probability of a value falling within a certain range. 

There are generally two ways to find these probabilities:
1. **Standardising** the value and using **Standard Normal Tables**.
2. Using an **online calculator** or statistical software directly.

Let's look at an example: Suppose the heights of adult males in a city are normally distributed with a mean, $\mu$, of 175 cm and a standard deviation, $\sigma$, of 10 cm. 

We write this distribution as:
$$X \sim N(175, 10^2)$$

</div>

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">

## Method 1: Using Standard Normal Tables

To use standard normal tables, we must first convert our $X$ value into a $Z$ score using the standardising formula:

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

**Example:** What is the probability that a randomly selected male is shorter than 190 cm? ($P(X < 190)$)

1. First, find the $z$-score for $x = 190$:
   $$z = \frac{190 - 175}{10} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5$$
2. This tells us that 190 cm is exactly 1.5 standard deviations above the mean. We now want to find $P(Z < 1.5)$.
3. Looking up $z = 1.5$ in a <a href="https://math.arizona.edu/~rsims/ma464/standardnormaltable.pdf" target="_blank">standard normal table</a> gives us **0.9332**.

So, $P(X < 190) = 0.9332$.

*(Note: If you wanted to find the probability of being **taller** than 190 cm, $P(X > 190)$, you would subtract this value from 1, because the total probability under the curve is always 1. So, $1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668$).*

</div>

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">

## Method 2: Using an Online Calculator Directly

If you have an online calculator or a graphical calculator, you do not always need to standardise to $Z$ first. You can input the mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) of your specific distribution directly.

**Example:** What is the probability that a randomly selected male is taller than 165 cm? ($P(X > 165)$)

Instead of calculating the $z$-score by hand, we can use a calculator. 
1. Enter the mean $\mu = 175$.
2. Enter the standard deviation $\sigma = 10$.
3. Enter $165$ as the raw score

  </div>
</div>
<script defer src="https://cdn.gigacalculator.com/embed.min.js"></script>

**Use this calculator to confirm that $P(X > 165) = 0.8413$.**

*(Note: If you had standardised this, $z = \frac{165 - 175}{10} = -1.0$. Using the symmetry of the normal tables, $P(Z > -1.0)$ is exactly the same as $P(Z < 1.0) = 0.8413$. Both methods yield the exact same result!)*

</div>

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">

## Probabilities Between Two Values

Often, you will need to find the probability that a value falls *between* two numbers, $P(a < X < b)$. To do this, find the probability of being less than the upper boundary, and subtract the probability of being less than the lower boundary:

$$P(a < X < b) = P(X < b) - P(X < a)$$

**Example:** What is the probability that a randomly selected male is between 165 cm and 190 cm? ($P(165 < X < 190)$)

**Using Tables:**
1. We already know from Method 1 that for 190 cm ($z = 1.5$), the area to the left is **0.9332**.
2. For 165 cm, $z = -1.0$. Looking this up in the tables gives an area to the left of **0.1587**.
3. Subtract the smaller area from the larger area: 
   $$0.9332 - 0.1587 = 0.7745$$

**Using the Calculator:**
Because the embedded calculator above provides basic "Less than" or "Greater than" options, you perform the exact same subtraction:
1. Enter 190 as the raw score, and hit Calculate to get **0.93319** for less than.
2. Enter 165, and hit Calculate to get **0.15865** for less than.
3. Subtract the two values yourself: $0.93319 - 0.15865 = 0.77454$.

So, $P(165 < X < 190) = 0.7745$.

### Questions

Test your understanding. The weights of a certain type of apple, $X$, are normally distributed with a mean weight of 120g and a standard deviation of 15g. 

This means $X \sim N(120, 15^2)$.

## Working Backwards: The Inverse Normal Distribution

Sometimes we are given the probability (or percentage) and need to work backwards to find the specific value. This is known as the **inverse normal** method.

Let's look at a new example. The daily commute time, $C$, for a worker is normally distributed with a mean of 45 minutes and a standard deviation of 8 minutes.

We write this as:
$$C \sim N(45, 8^2)$$

**Example: The worker wants to know the commute time that is only exceeded 10% of the time. i.e. Find $c$ such that $P(C > c) = 0.10$.**

### Method 1: Working backwards from the Tables

If $P(C > c) = 0.10$, then the area to the *left* is $0.90$. So, $P(C < c) = 0.90$.

1. Look in the **body** (the middle) of the standard normal tables for the value closest to $0.9000$. 
2. The closest value is $0.8997$, which corresponds to a $z$-score of **1.28**. (More precise tables or calculators might give 1.2816).
3. We now rearrange the standardising formula $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$ to solve for $x$:
   $$x = \mu + z\sigma$$
4. Substitute our values in:
   $$c = 45 + (1.28 \times 8) = 45 + 10.24 = 55.24 \text{ minutes}$$

### Method 2: Using an Inverse Normal Calculator

Most graphical calculators and online statistics tools have an **Inverse Normal** function. 
 
1. Select "Z from Probability" (or the equivalent option).
2. Enter the Probability (e.g., $0.90$ for the area to the left).
3. The calculator will directly output the z-score.
4. We now rearrange the standardising formula $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$ to solve for $x$:
   $$x = \mu + z\sigma$$
5. Substitute our values in:
   $$c = 45 + (1.28 \times 8) = 45 + 10.24 = 55.24 \text{ minutes}$$
